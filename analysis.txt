The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing 
campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in 
order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed.

As we can see from our EDA, a lot of the data was of categorical type and thus was converted by either 
label/ordinal or one-hot encoding. The ourliers from numerical data were removed by either iqr method or 
logic and the data was scaled for the sake of proper work of our distance-based classifiers. A new feature
'year' was created as different years might have different financial times behind them. Our target variable 
was also extremely unbalanced (1:9) thus SMOTE method was used on the training dataset.

The hyper-parameters were chosed based on what parameteres could possibly be beneficial to the classifier
the grid search was used on.
